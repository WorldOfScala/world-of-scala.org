# Welcome World Of Scala project

![World Of Scala](./docs/images/worldofscala.png)

## Overview

"World of Scala" is a full-stack web application built entirely in Scala. It showcases a modern, type-safe technology stack and is designed to be a social platform for Scala developers. The application allows users to create accounts, form organizations, and contribute 3D models (meshes) that are displayed on a 3D globe.

The project is structured as a multi-project sbt build, with clear separation between the server-side, client-side, and shared code. This modular design promotes code reuse and maintainability.

## Technology Stack

The project leverages a range of modern libraries and frameworks from the Scala ecosystem:

*   **Backend:**
    *   **ZIO:** For asynchronous and concurrent programming.
    *   **Tapir:** For defining type-safe, boilerplate-free HTTP endpoints.
    *   **Quill:** For type-safe database queries.
    *   **Flyway:** For managing database migrations.
    *   **PostgreSQL:** As the primary database.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Scala.js:** For writing frontend code in Scala.
    *   **Laminar:** For building reactive user interfaces.
    *   **Three.js:** For rendering the 3D globe and meshes.
    *   **frontroute:** For client-side routing.
*   **Build & Deployment:**
    *   **sbt:** As the build tool.
    *   **Docker:** For containerizing the application.
    *   **docker-compose:** For orchestrating the application and database services.
    *   **npm & vite:** For managing frontend dependencies and serving the client in development mode.
    *   **ArgoCD**: For continuous deployment in Kubernetes environments.


## Architecture

The project is divided into three main modules:

*   **`shared`:** This module contains code that is shared between the server and the client. This includes:
    *   **Domain Models:** Definitions for users, organizations, and meshes.
    *   **API Endpoints:** Tapir endpoint definitions that are used by both the server (to implement the API) and the client (to call the API).
    *   **Error Handling:** A unified error handling mechanism that maps application-specific exceptions to HTTP error codes.

*   **`server`:** This module contains the backend application logic. Key components include:
    *   **Controllers:** Implement the logic for the API endpoints defined in the `shared` module.
    *   **Services:** Contain the business logic for managing users, organizations, and meshes.
    *   **Repositories:** Provide a type-safe interface for accessing the database using Quill.
    *   **Authentication:** Implements JWT-based authentication.
    *   **Database Migrations:** SQL scripts for managing the database schema with Flyway.

*   **`client`:** This module contains the frontend application logic, written in Scala.js. Key components include:
    *   **UI Components:** Built with Laminar to create a reactive and modular user interface.
    *   **Routing:** Uses `frontroute` to manage client-side navigation.
    *   **3D Rendering:** Uses Three.js to render the 3D globe and meshes.
    *   **API Client:** A type-safe API client generated from the Tapir endpoints defined in the `shared` module.

## Database

The application uses a PostgreSQL database, with the schema managed by Flyway. The database schema has evolved over time to include:

*   **`users`:** Stores user information, including credentials.
*   **`organisations`:** Stores information about organizations, including their name, location, and the user who created them.
*   **`meshes`:** Stores 3D model data, including a label and an optional thumbnail.

The use of Flyway ensures that the database schema is always in a consistent state and can be easily evolved as the application grows.

## Deployment

The application is designed to be run in a containerized environment using Docker.

### Locally

 The `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose-all.yml` files provide a convenient way to run the application and its database with a single command.

The `docker-compose-all.yml` file defines two services:

*   **`db`:** A PostgreSQL database service.
*   **`web`:** The application server, which is built from a Docker image.

This setup makes it easy to run the application in a development or production environment with minimal configuration.

I have analyzed the project and provided a comprehensive explanation. I am now ready to switch to another mode to implement any changes you might have in mind.

### ArgoCD

The project can also be deployed in a Kubernetes environment using ArgoCD for continuous deployment. The `k8s` directory contains the necessary Kubernetes manifests and ArgoCD application definitions to deploy the application and manage its lifecycle.


## Pre-requisites

* JDK
* sbt
* Node.js
* Docker running

Decent vesions of JDK, sbt and Node.js are required.

## Getting started

To get started, run the following command:

```bash
./scripts/fullstackRun.sh
```

<http://localhost:8080/public/index.html>

## Development

Development is done in two parts: the server and the client.

* The server is a ZIO application that serves the client.

* The client is a Scala.js application that is served by the server.

  * The client is built using the `fastLinkJS` command.
  * Vite is used to serve the client in development mode, with hot reloading.

### VS Code

VS Code is the recommended IDE for this project. The project is configured to work with Visual Studio Code.

* The Scala (Metals) extension is recommended.

Just open the project in VS Code:

```bash
code .
```

Details here [VS Code](./docs/vscode.md).

### Manually

Details on how to setup the development environment manually can be found in the [manual](./docs/manual.md).

## Production

To build the project for production, run the following command:

* With ESModule

```bash
./scripts/fullstackBuild.sh
```

* With CommonJS

```bash
./scripts/fullstackBuild.sh -n
```

Details here [Production](./docs/production.md).
